# Applied machine-learning for science

ðŸ’» Material for a course on applied machine-learning for scientists taught at
EPFL in spring 2018.

# Outline

The course consists of six two hour lectures, followed by one hour to discuss
the week's homework assignment. Followed by a final project on real world data.

* Intro and Model Performance
* Tree based models
* Neural Networks
* Feature engineering
* Embeddings and pretrained networks
* Interpretability


# Technicalities, installing, running code

All the code will be written in python. We will make use of the scientific
python stack:

* python v3.6
* numpy v1.12.1
* scikit-learn v0.19
* keras
* matplotlib v2.x.x
* jupyter

All work submitted for credit has to run with these dependencies only.

[Instructions on installing](install.md) on Windows, mac and linux.
